### Description
MileEdge is an app which allows users to create a log of each time they get gas for their car.

Users can record their mileage, the amount of gas purchased and at what price, and even what gas station they visited. The idea being that keeping a close eye on your fuel consumption can help you to economize your driving style and to help "train" yourself to drive more economically, getting the most for your money.
